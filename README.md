# BME 547 Class Exercises
This course focuses on software design skills that are ubiquitous in the medical device industry, including software version control, unit testing, fault tolerance, continuous integration testing, documentation, databases, and servers. Projects are related to medical devices and databases that measure and process biosignals, send information to a web server, and make those data accessible to a web client.
